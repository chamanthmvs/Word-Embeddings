If you imagine an animal of size 25 and cuteness 30, then you can easily look at the space to find the animal that most closely fits that description: From the table, we can say it is \"chicken\" (based on data).\n",

Depending on your implementation of this procedure, though, you might want a context with a bigger \"window\" (example -- two words before and after) or a non-contiguous window (skip a word before and after the given word). \n",

       " We could see now the sandy\n",
       " road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.,\n",
       " The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock\n",
       " my own disappointment.,\n",
       " I was already thinking what I had best do, when\n",
       " the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I\n",

       " Then,\n",
       " amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing\n",
       " of themselves, a calÃ¨che, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook\n",

       " I could see from the flash of our\n",

       " sudden fright.,\n",
       " Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each\n",
       " side of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which\n",
       " affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to\n",
       " jump from the calÃ¨che and run, whilst they reared again and plunged\n",
       " madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them\n",
       " from bolting.,\n",
       " In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to\n",
       " the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able\n",
       " to descend and to stand before them.,\n",
       " He petted and soothed them, and\n",
       " whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers\n",
       " doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became\n",
       " quite manageable again, though they still trembled.,\n",
       " The driver again\n",
       " took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace.,\n",
       " This\n",
       " time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a\n",

       " ,\n",
       " Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the\n",
       " roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning,\n",
       " rocks guarded us boldly on either side.,\n",
       " Though we were in shelter, we\n",
       " could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the\n",
       " rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.,\n",
       " It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,\n",
       " so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket.,\n",
       " The\n",
       " keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew\n",
       " fainter as we went on our way.,\n",
       " The baying of the wolves sounded nearer\n",
       " and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side.,\n",
       " I\n",
       " grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear.,\n",
       " The driver,\n",
       " however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to\n",
       " left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.\n",
       " ,\n",
       " Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame.,\n",
       " The\n",
       " driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,\n",
       " jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness.,\n",
       " I did not know\n",
       " what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while\n",
       " I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took\n",
       " his seat, and we resumed our journey.,\n",
       " I think I must have fallen asleep\n",
       " and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated\n",
       " endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.,\n",
       " Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness\n",
       " around us I could watch the driver's motions.,\n",
       " He went rapidly to where\n",
       " the blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem\n",
       " to illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones,,\n",
       " formed them into some device.,\n",
       " Once there appeared a strange optical\n",
       " effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,\n",
       " for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same.,\n",
       " This startled me, but\n",
       " as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me\n",
       " straining through the darkness.,\n",
       " Then for a time there were no blue\n",
       " flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the\n",
       " wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.\n",
       " ,\n",
       " At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he\n",
       " had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse\n",
       " than ever and to snort and scream with fright.,\n",
       " I could not see any cause\n",
       " for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just\n",
       " then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the\n",
       " jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw\n",
       " around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,\n",
       " with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair.,\n",
       " They were a hundred times more\n",
       " terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.,\n",
       " For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear.,\n",
       " It is only when a man\n",

       " their true import.\n",

       " All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had\n",
       " some peculiar effect on them.,\n",
       " The horses jumped about and reared, and\n",
       " looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;\n",
       " but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they\n",
       " had perforce to remain within it.,\n",
       " I called to the coachman to come, for,\n",
       " it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the\n",
       " ring and to aid his approach.,\n",
       " I shouted and beat the side of the\n",
       " calÃ¨che, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as\n",
       " to give him a chance of reaching the trap.,\n",
       " How he came there, I know\n",
       " not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and\n",
       " looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway.,\n",
       " As he swept his\n",
       " long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves\n",
       " fell back and back further still.,\n",
       " Just then a heavy cloud passed across\n",
       " the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.\n",

       " When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calÃ¨che, and the\n",

       " dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move.,\n",
       " The time\n",
